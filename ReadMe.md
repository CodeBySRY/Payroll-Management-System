# Payroll Management System ðŸ’¼ðŸ’°

> **A ***C++ solution*** automating payroll processing to eliminate manual errors and improve efficiency**;

### **Problem Statement:**

Running payroll is one of the most important responsibilities for business owners.
Put simply, a payroll management system is the process by which employers pay wages to their employees.  Itâ€™s also how they demonstrate their commitment to their workers, fulfill their obligations to government agencies and keep financial records in order. Employers with a few employees may opt to manage payroll using a manual method, such as spreadsheets. The potential cost savings, however, are usually outweighed by the pitfalls. 

**Manual DIY processes** increase the risk of costly mistakes and take time away from activities that drive business growth.

### **Proposed Solution**:

Payroll software integrates with other core business systems to ensure that employees receive accurate, on-time compensation in the appropriate manner (such as direct deposit, check, or payment card). Employees can typically access the software to edit their personal information, payment preferences, and other details.
For employers, payroll systems need to be reliable, easy to configure, and flexible enough to manage and automate payments to workers of all types (including salaried and hourly employees, temporary and gig workers, and others), at different locations around the world. 

Payroll systems should simplify tasks, making it easier for staff to manage complex rules, payroll flows, and checklists, and maintain compliance with tax laws and other financial regulations.
